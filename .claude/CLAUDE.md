- When producing Python code, please only add docstrings in situations where the code is particular complex and nuanced. In general, the code should read like a book so docstrings should not be needed.

## Context Efficiency (Advanced Tool Use)

- Request summaries instead of raw data when possible
- Use batch operations for multiple items
- Process data in code, return only final results
- For large datasets, compute aggregates rather than returning all records
