## Python

- Only add docstrings for complex/nuanced code. Code should read like a book.

## Context Efficiency (Advanced Tool Use)

- Request summaries instead of raw data when possible
- Use batch operations for multiple items
- Process data in code, return only final results
- For large datasets, compute aggregates rather than returning all records
