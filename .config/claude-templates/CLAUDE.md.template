## Tool Usage Patterns

### Batch Operations

When working with multiple files/resources, write code to process in batches:

```python
# Batch processing - efficient
results = await asyncio.gather(*[process(item) for item in items])
summary = {"total": len(items), "success": sum(1 for r in results if r.ok)}

# One-by-one - inefficient
# Don't request each item separately
```

### Context Efficiency

- Use `git diff --stat` before full diffs
- Summarize large outputs rather than showing everything
- For data processing, show aggregates not raw data

## Git Workflow

1. Create worktree: `worktree-new feature-name --claude`
2. Develop in isolated environment
3. Create PR when ready
4. After merge: `worktree-cleanup`
